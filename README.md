# Dmenu script for khard contacts

Run this script, select a contact by name and select phone or email. Your choice will be copied to your clipboard via xlip.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/PatrikTrefil/dmenu-khard-contacts.git
cd ./dmenu-khard-contacts
./scont
```

You need a tool to sync your contacts. You will probably need a CardDAV client. This tool is optimised for [khard](https://github.com/scheibler/khard/).

Dmenu is required. You can get it as a package from all major repositories or download from [the official website](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) and build manually.
